        "description": " On July 21, Union troops flooded over the battlefield, fording the creeks, and flanking the strongest points in the Confederate lines. The Southern forces fell back. Confederate troop reinforcements soon poured out of a train at Manassas. The lack of a distinct uniform led some Northerners to mistake Southerners for their own troops. Soon realizing their mistakes, the Northerners began to pull back and run, giving the Confederacy its first victory.",

The Confederates had thirty-five thousand men to McClellan’s seventy-two thousand. The battle ended in confusion and stalemate. More men were killed, wounded, or declared missing on this day than on any other day in the Civil War.",

With Southerners able to fire down on them from protected positions, Union soldiers were killed and injured in staggering numbers. At battle’s end, both armies remained where they had been at the beginning.",

        "description": " On the Fourth of July, the very morning after the Union’s victory at Gettysburg, Vicksburg surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant. Vicksburg held tactical and psychological importance. It had been the symbol of Confederate doggedness and Union frustration. The Union’s conquest of Vicksburg in July and  Port Hudson in May—the last Confederate holdouts on the Mississippi River—meant that the river now divided the Confederacy while it tied the Union to the Gulf of Mexico. After hearing of the fall of Vicksburg, a pleased Lincoln exclaimed, “The father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea.",

McClellan still commanded troops, but his role was restricted. The new Union leaders removed McClellan’s troops from the Virginia peninsula and consolidated them, under the joint command of General John Pope, with troops from the Shenandoah Valley. The forces began to move from the peninsula in August.",

In November, they overpowered the Confederates on Lookout Mountain outside Chattanooga; two days later, Union soldiers shocked the Confederates by fighting their way up the steep Missionary Ridge. Chattanooga fell to Grant’s troops on November 23. The Union, now in control of the cities and rail junctions of Kentucky and Tennessee, had a direct route into Georgia.",

        "description": " While Grant would fight in Virginia, William T. Sherman would attack the railroad center of Atlanta, cutting off the Deep South from the Upper South. The loss of Atlanta would chop the Confederacy into pieces too small to resist the Northern army. Throughout June and July, Sherman pushed through Georgia toward Atlanta. By the end of July, the Southern army had fallen back into Atlanta, preparing to defend it. It seemed only a matter of time before the Union triumphed. Just when it appeared that the Democrats would unseat Lincoln, news from the battlefield changed everything: Sherman had begun destroying the railroads that made Atlanta an important junction. The Confederates set much of Atlanta on fire and abandoned it. Sherman and his army marched into the city on September 2.",

        "description": "A week after Lincoln’s re-election, Sherman set out across Georgia, taking the war to the Southern people themselves. Such a march would be “a demonstration to the world, foreign and domestic, that we have a power which Davis cannot resist,” Sherman argued. The triumphant army—sixty thousand strong and in five columns, spread across a broad swath of territory—made its way across the state in the fall of 1864. Sherman’s troops laid waste to the Georgia countryside. Union troops were ordered to destroy the railroad network and to forage for food, seizing it from nearby farmers. Troop commanders were empowered to destroy factories, cotton gins, and private homes in areas determined to be hostile, and were given instructions to seize horses, mules, and wagons as needed.  To make matters worse for residents in the path of Sherman’s soldiers, large numbers of deserters from both sides, fugitive slaves and outlaws all used the situation to inflict widespread destruction and panic. Sherman arrived at Savannah on December 21. “I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah,” Sherman telegraphed Lincoln.",

The assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln took place on April 14, 1865, as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army of the Potomac. Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated, though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835. The assassination was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause.",
